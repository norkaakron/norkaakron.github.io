        My work examines the disparate and sometimes difficult emotions along with 
      critiquing contemporary issues in society such as: traditional beauty standards, 
      women’s rights, and environmental issues. I work with in a wide variety of mediums: 
      traditional drawing, animation, photography, sculpture, AR/VR, creative coding, and many more. 
      I especially love to mix a variety of different mediums to break the rules of what can be combined. 
      
      Imaginary figures taking form out of abstract shapes. What exists in these animations 
      can only exist here. My characters are a glimpse of another dimension: sometimes tranquil, 
      sometimes deranged. Some eyes droop with a lifetime of sorrow others are merely gaping holes. 
      Some characters lack a soul while other characters overflow with emotion. I have a Glitch Art piece, 
      Lancome, that splices Julia Robert’s face in a Lancome Beauty Cream ad. We see beauty ads all the 
      time which use photoshop to an extreme to sell something unattainable. These false images along with 
      over-the-top claims are a misleading attempt to sell the image of perfection. I chose to break this ad 
      from the inside out. I made this advertisement defective much like its defective scheme of deceiving the public.
 
      Many of the contemporary issues I put into my work deal with issues of equality, being a typical woman I have already 
      dealt with a fair share of oppression. We have come a long way from the days 
      of the women’s suffrage movement, however the fight is far from over and women’s voices must be heard. 
      I want men and women to experience my work and come out with a sense of awareness or simply a reminder of 
      important issues that still affect us everyday.
